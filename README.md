> CLI tool to spin up Docker cluster of Bee nodes for advanced testing and/or development

**Warning: This project is in beta state. There might (and most probably will) be changes in the future to its API and working. Also, no guarantees can be made about its stability, efficiency, and security at this stage.**

## Install

**Requirements:** Docker

```shell
$ npm install -g @ethersphere/bee-factory
```

## Usage

**Starting with Bee Factory's version `0.5.0` it is compatible only with Bee version `1.9.0` and higher!**

```shell
# This spins up the cluster for specific Bee version and exits
$ bee-factory start --detach 1.9.0

# The spins up the cluster using Bee version configured in external places. See below for options where to place it.
$ bee-factory start --detach

# This attaches to the Queen container and displays its logs
$ bee-factory logs queen --follow

# This stops the cluster and keeping the containers so next time they are spinned up the data are kept
# but data are not persisted across version's bump!
$ bee-factory stop

# You can also spin up the cluster without the --detach which then directly
# attaches to the Queen logs and the cluster is terminated upon SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
$ bee-factory start 1.9.0
```

For more details see the `--help` page of the CLI and its commands.

### External Bee version configuration

You can omit the Bee version argument when running `bee-factory start` command if you specify it in one of the expected places:

 - `package.json` placed in current working directory (cwd) under the `engines.bee` property.
 - `.beefactory.json` placed in current working directory (cwd) with property `version`.

### Docker Images

Bee Factory as the NPM package that you can install, like mentioned above, works in a way that it orchestrates launching Bee Factory Docker images
in correct order and awaits for certain initializations to happen in correct form. These Docker images are automatically built with our CI
upon every new Bee release, so you can just specify which version you want to run (starting with `1.9.0` version) as part of the `start` command.

If for some reason you want built your own images, that is possible but discouraged and not supported (**here be dragons**) using the scripts in the `generator` subfolder.
Upon building and publishing these images you can consume them using with Bee Factory with the `--repo` flag.

#### Latest versions

There is special Bee Factory image tag `latest` that has the latest Bee's master build.
It is not recommended using this tag unless you need to test some upcoming feature and know what are you doing.
There is high chance that there might be some change in Bee that is not compatible with current Bee Factory and so it might not even work.

### Developing

You can run the CLI while developing using `npm start -- <command> ...`.

### Local images

If you want to locally build the Bee Factory images, then edit the `./generator/scripts/.env` file with appropriate configuration
and then run the `./generator/scripts/build-environment.sh` script. This will build the images with the `ethersphere/bee-factory-*` tags.
Then simply run the `npm start -- <command>` with the appropriate version of Bee you have build.
The CLI should pickup local images prior trying to pull it from Docker Hub, so it will use your build ones.

### Updating Blockchain images

If Bee updated its smart contracts suite, then smart contracts needs to be updated in Bee Factory as well otherwise the spawned Bees might
have unpredictable behavior.

First of all you have to preprocess the smart contract's bytecodes. In Solidity the constructor parameters are passed to the contract by appending the parameters
ABI-encoded to the end of the bytecode (for more see for example [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/58866/how-does-a-contracts-constructor-work-and-load-input-values)).
So you have to make sure that the bytecodes that you update are stripped of these constructor parameters.
This is because these parameters are then later on appended during smart contract deployment.

If only internal smart contract's logic has changed and there is no change to the smart contract's constructor, then you have to only
update the bytecodes. You do it by pasting the bytecodes to appropriate files in `./generator/contracts/` folder.

If there are new smart contracts or their constructor's have changed then you have to also modify the deploy script which is present in
`./generator/migrations/1_initial.js` file. **Don't remove the logging that starts with `::CONTRACT:`!** This serves to extract the deployed
contracts addresses and apply them to the Docker image's label.

If you are adding new smart contract than also add new `::CONTRACT:` log line that has format of `::CONTRACT:<bee-option-name>:<smart-contract-address>`,
where the `bee-option-name` stands for the option name that customize the contract's address in Bee.

Last step is to bump the `BLOCKCHAIN_VERSION` version in `./generator/scripts/.env` file.
